Step 1: 
Run the command 'make all' to compile all the codes
It is equivalent to execute 'make source' and then execute 'make test'

Step 2:
Run the command 'make run-test' to verify the engine

Step 3:
Run the command 'make run' to run the part 1 and part 2 of the project.
The output of the part 1 will be written to out.csv
It is equivalent to execute 'make run-part1' first and then execute 'make run-part2' 

Alternative Step:
Run the command 'make clean' to clean the generate codes
